# ontology-query-service

The ontology query service is an app that 
  1.) accesses a locally stored ontology (in RDF, JSON-LD etc. formats)
  2.) presents the user a dropdown list of pre-defined questions she/he can choose from
  3.) the backend translates these questions in SPARQL queries and
  4.) displays the results

use 'runApp("app")' to start it from within the R environment
